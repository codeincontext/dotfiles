#+TITLE: flow-type layer

* Description
This layer adds some [[https://flowtype.org/][flow]] related functionality to Emacs:
 - Show the flow-type of the object under the cursor using Eldoc
 - Add flow checking to flycheck (based on the flycheck-flow package)
 - company-mode completion using company-flow
 - "compilation" using =flow status=

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =flow-type= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file. Please ensure you already have the flow binary installed, either in
node_modules or in your PATH.

The type under the cursor is shown automatically using eldoc.  You may find this
a little sluggish, depending on your setup - if so, you can disable it by setting
=flow-type-enable-eldoc-type-info= to =nil=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(flow-type :variables flow-type-enable-eldoc-type-info nil)
#+END_SRC

You can always show types manually using =flow-minor-type-at-pos=,
bound to =,ft= by default.
